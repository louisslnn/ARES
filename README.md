# ARES
ARES is a production-ready predictive maintenance system designed for real-time telemetry analysis of critical UAV components. This end-to-end solution leverages time-series deep learning to detect subtle anomalies and forecast component failure probability, drastically reducing unexpected in-flight electrical failures and maintenance costs.
